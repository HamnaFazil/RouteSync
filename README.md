# RouteSync (SmartRoute AI)

Advanced Route Optimization & Emergency Navigation System

---

## Overview

**RouteSync** is a high-performance, graph-based navigation system that computes optimal routes in dynamic urban networks. Leveraging real-time traffic updates, road block detection, and emergency prioritization, it delivers efficient, reliable, and adaptive pathfinding. Built entirely as a solo project, it showcases deep mastery of **data structures, algorithms, and modern web development**.

---

## Features

* **Dynamic shortest-path computation** using Dijkstra, A*, and Bellman-Ford
* **Real-time traffic simulation** with dynamic edge weights
* **Emergency vehicle routing** prioritizing fastest response
* **Interactive visualization** of algorithm execution and pathfinding
* **Road blocking and rerouting** for realistic urban simulations

---

## Tech Stack

* **Vite** – Fast frontend tooling
* **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript
* **React** – Component-based interactive UI
* **shadcn-ui** – Clean, accessible UI components
* **Tailwind CSS** – Efficient, responsive styling

---

## Data Structures & Algorithms

* Graph (Adjacency List) – Efficient representation of road networks
* Priority Queue (Min Heap) – Optimized node selection
* Hash Map – Fast lookup for nodes and edges
* Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford – Core pathfinding algorithms for real-time decision making

---

## How to Use

1. **Select Start (🟢) and End (🔴) nodes**
2. **Choose Algorithm**: Dijkstra, A*, Bellman-Ford
3. **Click “Find Optimal Route”** to visualize the path

**Advanced Controls:**

* Block roads to simulate closures
* Simulate traffic congestion
* Enable emergency mode for priority routing
* Reset system to initial state

**Visual Indicators:**
🟢 Start | 🔴 End | 🔵 Optimal Path | 🟡 Visited Nodes | 🟠 Traffic | ❌ Blocked Roads
